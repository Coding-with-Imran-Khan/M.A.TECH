My Awesome Project

This project showcases everything I've learned about web development! Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP Mailer, Animate.css, Waypoint, Bootstrap 5, jQuery, and a Lightbox plugin, it boasts a range of interactive features:

Responsive Animated Hamburger Menu: A sleek hamburger menu that animates on mobile screens, likely using AI-powered tools.
Auto-Counting Feature: Watch the numbers climb as you scroll down to the Feature section, powered by jQuery's magic.
Convenient WhatsApp Button: Easily connect with me via WhatsApp with a single click.
Project Section with Lightbox: Click on any project to experience stunning details in a lightbox display.
Tabbed Pony Cables Page: Smoothly navigate through Pony Cables content using Bootstrap 5 tabs.
Searchable Download Page: Find exactly what you need with a user-friendly search category implemented using JavaScript.
Fully Functional Contact Form: Though I'm not a backend developer, I've cleverly implemented a two-way verification system (details omitted for security reasons). This form, along with the footer's subscribe form, successfully submits data, even though the backend code (mail.php) is excluded due to security concerns.
Note: The mail.php file is not included as it contains sensitive information about my Google Apps and password. However, the functionality of the contact and subscribe forms is intact, with a "Thank you" message displayed upon successful submission.

Feel free to explore the project and see what I've built!
